To use these example in Rancher Manager, add this repository as a Helm Repository - to do this:

- Go to the local cluster, to 'Apps' and 'Repositories'
- Click 'Create' and enter a name, e.g. 'example-extensions'
- Choose Target 'Git repository containing Helm chart or cluster template definitions'
- Enter `https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples.git` for the 'Git Repo URL'
- Enter `main` for the Git Branch
- Click `Create`

The extensions should then appear on the 'Extenssions' page in Rancher Manager.

## Building and running locally

You can build and run the extensions locally, to do so:

- Run `yarn install`
- Set the API environment variable to point to a Rancher backend
- Run Rancher in development mode with `yarn dev`
- Open a web browser to `https://127.0.0.1:8005`

Once you login, you should see Rancher load with the extensions automatically loaded. You can edit the code for the extensions
and then should hot-reload within the browser.
